**Part 1: Questions about the reading by Thompson and Warzel**

### Q 1: Explain personal privacy and what it means to you.

Personal privacy, in my eyes, is the right to have any and all information not explicitly needed by the government or my employment kept from the public eye. This is referring to information about my social life, the relationships I keep, my morning routine, my recreational activities, the time I go to bed at night, the time I wake up in the morning, etc. All of these details, some more trivial than others, are the pieces that make up my identity, which I hold very dear to me. There are many parts of my identity, however, that are reserved for just me and the people I know as that is what makes them important. The joy of getting to know someone and having them reveal the things that are unique to them is completely destroyed if they have a complete lack of personal privacy. This is why it is of paramount importance to preserve this and limit the parts of our individuality that get broadcasted to the world.

### Q 2: As you understand it from the article, does the tracking technology discussed in the article pose a threat to personal privacy? Explain your thoughts.

Absolutely, in almost every imaginable way. Considering all of the points they laid out, most if not all of the tracking data these companies collect is without any form of regulation or actual security. Even though it is collected under the guise that there is no way of identifying the individual the data is taken from, it doesn’t take a data scientist to connect the dots. To further this point, the article proved that simply with the information it was given, the New York Times was able to identify a plethora of specific individuals with nothing more than their location history. This is the largest threat to personal privacy in recent history, as our movement throughout the day can paint a vivid picture of our private lives. With individual location information being collected in mass, there is no doubt that several people you will never meet in your life know more about you than some of your closest friends. This is a boundary that must be protected at all costs.

### Q 3: Are there other concerns that you see regarding anything mentioned in the article? Explain your thoughts.

I am concerned about the grander implications that these location data leaks could pose for the general public, specifically regarding individual health. We already have such an incredible health insurance issue in the United States, where prices get raised the more people are in need of medical help. If insurance companies were able to obtain data regarding your proximity to someone with an infectious illness, a trip to an area where there is a heightened risk for rare diseases, or even traveling to known neighborhoods where your likelihood of drug use can be predicted, there is no end to the lengths some insurance companies will go to charge the most for proper health care coverage. Additionally, the risk of employers seeing into our personal lives poses a needless threat to potential income. If someone’s boss has a predilection for certain behaviors outside of the workplace or even certain socioeconomic backgrounds, these could impact the chances of employment even though they are irrelevant factors to someone’s professional aptitude.

### Q 4: How will the right to personal freedom evolve in the future? For example, would one be able to become truly anonymous in the future? Explain the change and discuss your perspective.

I believe as we head further into the digital age, we must look toward the decentralization and regulation of our internet data. True anonymity may already be unattainable, as at every turn we are creating bits and pieces of information that can be uniquely linked to us. At this point, our efforts are best spent limiting the freedom of which the information we generate is used for corporate purposes, and truly regaining control over what exactly we are comfortable sharing about ourselves. This may come in the form of more comprehensive and straightforward digital agreements, and putting policies in place that make sure we know explicitly what is being tracked and the ways in which it is being applied, secured, and stored. Heading towards the opt-in approach would be a great way to start, where users would have to repeatedly make the conscious decision to sign away their right to locational privacy.

### Q 5: Are there any comments or insights that you would like to make regarding the article?

I think spreading awareness about the very legitimate danger of location-tracking software is incredibly important in today’s day and age, where the internet and technology have become an integral part of everyone's life. Any attempt to make these practices more transparent to the laymen is a valuable step toward justice and the truth about the huge internet giants among us. I would love to see more articles like this and dive further into research about the many ways in which we are being monitored and turned into profit without our knowledge. While I don’t necessarily believe that using locational data to aid targeted marketing is a negative thing, I believe everyone has a right to know exactly where this data is going and the ways in which they can prevent its collection if they so choose.
